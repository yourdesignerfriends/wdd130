                    Hello, I'm Analina (some call me cookie). I like to make connections between people, this is why I decided to study Software Development. In some way I feel that we are all connected and that there is more than one person willing to give you what you need. My job is to help you find those people.

                <h2>Here's a little about my work experience and skills</h2>
                <p> When I graduated from high school I was admitted to study medicine at the university. This vocation is strongly linked to the fact that <b>I enjoy helping others</b>.<br><br>
                    I realized I know that studying Medicine took up a lot of my time and took me away from my family. Especially my mother, she was a widow and she needed my support to take care of my little brothers. Due to this situation I changed schools and began a career in <b>Public Accounting</b>.<br><br>
                    Studying public accounting helped me develop useful skills for my personal and professional life, two of the most important what they are:<br><br>
                    1. Working in an orderly and organized manner facilitates transparency.<br><br>
                    2. Numbers don't lie.<br><br>
                    One of my favorite classes was <b>economics</b>. My teacher was a little crazy but he was a genius. I learned that an economist is capable of predicting the future and that helped me be more <b>careful</b> and keep in mind that every decision I make will have a consequence.<br><br>
                    After a year my mother and I managed to have our own <b>family business</b>. I fulfilled the responsibilities of <b>manager and accounting bookkeeping.</b><br><br>
                    In 2008 something happened that marked my life forever. I left university and also the family business. At that moment I learned that <b>in life there are ups and downs</b>. I spent a couple of years working as a <b>salesperson</b> in stores which taught me <b>how to deal with the public, be friendly and develop humility.</b><br><br>
                    In 2016 I worked as a <b>manager</b> in a design store, where <b>I learned a lot about graphic design, fashion design, artistic composition and took some marketing and visual merchandising courses</b>.<br><br>
                    Right at that moment it was a time of great crisis in my native country Venezuela, inflation reached 1,370,000% according to the estimates of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is something difficult to believe but it happened and I lived it. <b>I learned to work under a lot of pressure</b>, every week I had to change product prices 3 or more times a day. I remember going to the movies with my mother and watching the price of popcorn change while we stood in line.<br><br>
                    I am a person who (like anyone) feels love for the place where I was born. In 2019 I learned to have <b>resilience, accept changes and that the strength of Faith is focused on our actions and the confidence to let ourselves be guided by God</b>. (with many tears in my eyes) I emigrated from my country to Panama. I arrived with all my capital (20 dollars) and a great desire to improve my living situation.<br><br>
                    I don't remember how many resumes I handed out the first week. (I had no legal status, so it was difficult to find work.) I remember reading an ad in English and knowing very little English. During this time <b>I learned a very important lesson, he who perseveres wins</b>. I managed to get this job as a <b>domestic worker</b> for a company that develops government renewable energy projects. I had my own room with a bathroom, a beautiful ocean view, all my meals covered, and a decent salary to help my mother and little brother in Venezuela.<br><br>
                    I still feel very grateful to my Heavenly Father for that job, my bosses were like my family. During the pandemic, although many people lost their jobs, I was lucky to have a job to help my mother and siblings. <b>I also learned culinary art and many delicious Chinese recipes</b>.<br><br>
                    During my free time at work <b>I started studying Cpanel, Wordpress, Social media advertising, Application programming interface (API) key and Web Programming on my own. I created some ecommerce and configured payment gateways</b>.<br><br>
                    During this time I met the love of my life who today is my beloved husband. Sometimes life takes us down unknown paths and many times full of challenges, but we should never doubt that we are on the right path.<br><br>
                    <b>I am currently improving my programming knowledge studying at BYU Idaho</b>, thanks to a program called BYU Pathway Worldwide that is a miracle in my life. If you are looking for someone who will give you 100% at work, contact me, I will be happy to help. Let the connections begin!
