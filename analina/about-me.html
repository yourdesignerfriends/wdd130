                    Hello, I'm Analina (some call me cookie). I like to make connections between people, this is why I decided to study Software Development. In some way I feel that we are all connected and that there is more than one person willing to give you what you need. My job is to help you find those people.

                <h2>Here's a little about my work experience and skills</h2>
                <p>When I graduated from high school I was admitted to study medicine at the university. This vocation is strongly linked to the fact that <b>I enjoy helping others</b>.<br></br>
                    I realized I know that studying Medicine took up a lot of my time and took me away from my family. Especially my mother, she was a widow and she needed my support to take care of my little brothers. Due to this situation I changed schools and began a career in <b>Public Accounting</b>.<br></br>
                    Studying public accounting helped me develop useful skills for my personal and professional life, two of the most important what they are:<br></br>
                    1. Working in an orderly and organized manner facilitates transparency.<br></br>
                    2. Numbers don't lie.<br></br>
                    One of my favorite classes was <b>Economics</b>. My teacher was a little crazy but he was a genius. I learned that an economist is capable of predicting the future and that helped me be more <b>careful</b> and keep in mind that every decision I make will have a consequence.<br></br>
