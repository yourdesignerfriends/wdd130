      <p>
      <p>Hello everyone, my name as it says above is Analina, you can call me Ana, I am from Venezuela and I currently</p>
      <p>live in the state of Washington with my husband. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since I was a </p>
      <p>child, that has been a blessing in my life ðŸ™‚. I like to design web pages. Until now, I have done it by watching</p> 
      <p>YouTube tutorials and I have made many mistakes. I am here to improve and have a professional path. Here I share with you</p> 
      <p>the most special moment of my life when I was sealed in the temple, I am 34 years old and I had always looked forward </p>
      <p>to this day. It wasn't easy but I have to tell you that everything that isn't easy is really worth it. Put a lot</p> 
      <p>of effort into your studies and the eternal things in life ðŸŒ¸, this is the way.</p>
      </p>
