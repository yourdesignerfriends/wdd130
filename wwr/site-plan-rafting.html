    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to become a local rafting community where we can share information, opinions and events about this activity within the state of Washington.</p>
    <!-- change this -->
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience is people between 18 and 60 years old who are passionate about rafting. They want to have opportunities to meet other people who share the same interests in this sport. As human beings, our nature is to be social. I would like to help fulfill the need to create connections between people. The audience of my website will use their mobile phone to a greater extent, performing searches such as: rafting near me. Our ideal audience will want to join the activities posted in the group or simply explore what's new in the world of Washington rafting.</p>
